            <p>
              The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria Export Promotion Group –
              MANEG is a group of Nigerian manufacturers who have joined hands
              together to promote Nigerian non-oil exports. MANEG is the largest
              recognized body dedicated to non-oil export promotion. Our
              reputation extends across both the business and governmental
              sectors. Internationally, the Economic Community of West African
              States – ECOWAS – recognizes us as a prominent stakeholder in the
              promotion of non-oil exports. The Export Expansion Grant – EEG –
              is the federal government’s post-shipment incentive for non-oil
              exports where we collaborate as a focal point between the
              government and private business organizations. We work with the
              Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) and a variety of Federal
              Ministries, including the Vice President’s Office to create a
              better business environment for Nigerian businesses involved in
              non-oil exports.

              <p>
                The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, MAN, established the
                MAN Export Promotion Group as one of its subgroups. MAN was
                founded in 1971 with the goal of bridging the communication gap
                between Nigerian manufacturers as a whole, the government, and
                the general public. MAN has been advocating for policies that
                enable Nigerian manufacturers build their operations since its
                inception.

              The MAN Export Promotion Group was established more than ten years
              ago, and since that time, Nigerian manufacturers have served as
              its chairpersons. The desire for advancing sustainable development
              in the nation is a trait that all of the group’s executives share,

            <p>
              Since its founding, MANEG has had 3 chairpersons, including our
              current chair, Chief Ede Dainone. All of the group’s chairs are
              from different manufacturing sectors, where they all held
              executive roles. Members of MANEG elect the group’s leadership,
              who are expected to represent the interests of all exporters in
              the nation, including members and non-members. To that end, all
              MANEG leaders are equally passionate about boosting non-oil
              exports to strengthen the nation’s economy. The list of our former
              chairs is below.

              Since its founding, MANEG has worked to create a friendly business

              significant progress, and we are happy to have contributed to the
              country’s expanding economic potential. As we collaborate with the
              Nigerian government to develop regulations and infrastructure that
              encourage global company emergence, we unquestionably anticipate
